# Astral
Organize Your GitHub Stars With Ease

**Please Note:** I am in the process of updating Astral to Laravel 5. Currently, the app cannot be built properly.

## Todo

These are the things that need to happen in order of contribution importance.

- **Complete upgrade to Laravel 5**: There's still lots of broken and old code that needs to be updated to work with Laravel 5. Particularly the controllers and models.
- **Test, tests, tests**: There are currently no tests anywhere, because I'm a bad person. Once the upgrade to L5 is complete, please feel free to start contributing as many tests as you can on both the backend, and on the Angular side. Testing methods can be discussed in a GitHub issue.
- **Performance**: Find all that crappy slow code I wrote, and make it faster! This can be on a the front or back end.
- **Better programming patterns/practices**: Should I be using something like the Repository pattern? Is the internal API poorly organized? Probably. Help me make it better!
- **New Features**: _Only_ after all of the above is completed shpould you start hacking on new features. No feature PR's will be accepted otherwise.
